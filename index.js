// Write a function called superbowlWin() in index.js:
// The function should receive 1 argument, an Array of JavaScript Objects
// Each object has two properties: year and result
// It should use find() to test each Object to see if the result is "W" â€” a win!
// It should return the year when the win occurred (if it occurred at all!)
// If no win is found, it should return, sadly, undefined.

// variable called "record" set to const. Is object nested within an array. 
const record = [
    { year: "2015", result: "W"},
    { year: "2014", result: "N/A"},
    { year: "2013", result: "L"},
  ]

  
  function superbowlWin(record) {
    let result = record.find(record => record.result === "W")
    if(result) {
      return result.year;
    } else {
      return undefined;
    }
  }
